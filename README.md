## First laboratory exercise description:
The target of this laboratory exercise is the deployment of searching alogrithms and best path discovery in N * N mazes.

## Environment of development:
Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. Colab allows you to use and share Jupyter notebooks with others without having to download, install, or run anything. Colab also offers access free of charge to computing resources including GPUs. Jupyter is the open source project on which Colab is based.
